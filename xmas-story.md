#Christmas Story
##Angel Sent to Mary
###God sent an angel to a young woman named Mary who was engaged to a man called Joseph. She was told that a baby boy was to be born to her who was to be the savior of the Jews.  He was to be called 'Jesus'.

##Mary Visits Elizabeth
### Mary visited Elizabeth, her cousin, who came to know that Mary was with a child. Elizabeth herself was with a child who was to prepare the way for Jesus. He was named 'John'.

##Joseph's Dilemma
### Joseph got worried when he came to know about Mary's conception,  because they were not married yet,but God told Joseph about his plan and to have faith in Him.

##The Call for Census
### The land Mary and Joseph lived in, was a part of roman empire, ruled by  Caesar Augustine. Caesar Augustine wanted a census of all people in the empire to make sure they paid their tax. He ordered all his subjects to return to their native towns and register themselves along with their families.

##The Journey to Bethlehem
### Mary and Joseph traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem where Joseph's family came from.  They had to travel slow because Mary's baby was due.

##Troubles in Bethlehem
### When they reached Bethlehem, they had trouble finding a place to stay. Every house was full and every bed was taken. The only accommodation that they could find was in an animal shelter.

##The Savior is Born
###So in a place where animals slept, Jesus, the son of God, was born to Mary. Jesus' bed was a manger that the animals ate hay from.

##Angel appears to Shepherds
###In the hills and fields at the outskirts of Bethlehem, were shepherds looking after their sheep. An angel appeared before them and the glory of God shone around them.

##The Good News
###The angel said, "I have a good news for you and everyone. Today, in Bethlehem, a savior has been born for you. You will find the baby lying in a manger."

##Angels Celebrate
###Many more angels appeared lighting up the sky. The shepherds heard them praising God singing glory to God in the highest and peace to everyone on Earth.

##The Shepherds visit baby Jesus
### So the shepherds went to Bethlehem and found Mary, Joseph and the new born baby. He was lying in a manger as told.

##Bright Star in the East
###When Jesus was born, a star brighter than any other, that had never been seen before, appeared in the sky. Three wise men, who studied stars, had read in ancient writings that a new star would appear when a great King was born.

##The Wise Men follow the Star
###The wise men followed the star towards the country of Judea. On reaching the capital, Jerusalem, they began asking people where the baby destined to be the king of Jews, was.

##Herod's Anger
###Herod, the king of Judea, heard this and it made him furious to think that someone might take his place. He told the wise men to go on following the Star until they found the new-born king.

##The wise men find Jesus
###So the three wise men continued to follow the Star towards Bethlehem. It seemed to stop and shine directly at the place where Jesus was.The wise men entered the house where they found Jesus with Mary, they bowed down and worshiped him. They spread the gifts that they had brought before Jesus.
